<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Shuyu Gan(甘书宇). I am an incoming CS PhD student at UMN [Minnesota NLP](https://minnesotanlp.github.io/) and [High-Performance Data, Signal and Network Optimization Group](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/index.html), co-advised by Prof. [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) and Prof. [Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html). My research interests focus on Generative AI, LLM Alignments and Agentic Framework Developments. My current goal is to develop general purpose agents that can automate computer work.

Previously, I was a member of [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en) in Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2024. During my undergraduate, I am grateful to be advised by Prof. [Lingyun Sun](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lingyun), Prof. [Yi Yang](https://reler.net/), Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) and Prof. [Xin Eric Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/). Check out my [CV](https://github.com/shuyugan/shuyugan.github.io/blob/main/docs/CV.pdf) for more details.

# 💻 Research Experience

- _2024.06 - 2024.11_ **Undergradute Visiting Research Intern, [ERIC Lab](http://eric-lab.soe.ucsc.edu/home), UC Santa Cruz**  
  Advised by Prof. [Xin Eric Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/), we introduced Agent S, an MLLM-based agent that autonomously perform complex computer tasks.

- _2023.07 - 2023.09_ **Undergradute Visiting Research Intern, [mlPC](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/Group.htm), UC San Diego**  
  Supervised by Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/), we injected conceptual guidance into Diffusion models’ training process to improve the quality of generatedimages and avoid making semantic mistakes.

- _2023.02 - 2023.05_ **Research Intern, [IDEA Lab](https://www.idi.zju.edu.cn/space/2747.html), ZJU**  
  Advised by Prof. [Lingyun Sun](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lingyun), we tackled the noticable absence of cultural modalities in the multimodal co-speech gesture generation field.
